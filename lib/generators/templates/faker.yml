# What it does, is just keep the amount of the records that is required to generate,
# and some other details conserning the generation way.
# All the records should obey the next principals
#
#   <plural form of model>_<approach>
#
# Here are some examples:
#
#   To generate the exact amount of users
#   users_amount: 100
#
#   To generate the random amount os the FeedEnitity's, with an average of 100 entities per
#   Feed the following construction may be used(a normal distribution approach will be used):
#   feed_ratio: 100
#
# For now there are only two aproaches: *amount* and *ratio*.
#

users_user: 1000
businesses_amount: 1234
feeds_amount: 100
feeds_entities_ratio: 100
